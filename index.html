                        <p>Frédéric Chopin <strong>(born March 1, 1810 in Żelazowa Wola, Poland - died October 17, 1849 in Paris, France)</strong>
                            was one of the leading composers and pianists in the history of classical music. He is best known for 
                            his piano-first works, combining melodic beauty, technical innovation and deep emotional expression. 
                            Chopin began his musical career at a young age, and by his early 20s, he was already recognized in Europe 
                            as a virtuoso pianist.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>Chopin moved to Paris in the 1830s, where he became the center of the music and arts community. His work consists
                            mostly of compositions for solo piano, including nocturnes, etudes, mazurkas, waltzes and polonaises. Chopin's 
                            music was heavily influenced by Polish culture and often reflected a sense of nationalism through folk music forms,
                            such as the mazurka and polonaise.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>Although his health often deteriorated due to an illness believed to be tuberculosis, Chopin continued to compose until 
                            the end of his life. He was known for his gentle yet emotive style of piano playing, which was very different from other 
                            virtuoso pianists of his time. After his death at the age of 39, Chopin left a deep legacy in the world of classical music, 
                            with his works continuing to be studied and played around the world to this day.
